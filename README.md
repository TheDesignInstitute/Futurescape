#What Futurescape is NOT?
Futurescape is not theme or brand guideline. It is a collection of UI components that look well together and have been  designed keeping real-world applications in mind .

#Why Futurescape? 
Futurescape has been designed keeping design, development, and scalability in mind. It will allow designers to use ready-made componenets in their designs and quickly validdate the concepts and layout options. 
It can also be used to check how different components will look together with different color options. 

#Is that based upon bootstrap?
Short answer Yes. Long answer No. 
You might find few shapes, paddings and margins similar to bootstrap, infact we took many bootstrap components and redesigned them for Futurescape because of their ease-of-use and happy users around the world. 
However, few UI components are not available in bootstrap and are still available in Futurescape because of additional benefits, usability and pleasing looks. 

#Why 1.618 as line-height?
While designing Futurescape, we were heavily influenced by Golden Ratio and hence line-height is set to nearest even number after multiplying font-size with 1.618. 
You can change it too. But do not push this here. We are still obssessed with Golden Ratio. 

#Why not Abstract or other Designer friendly platform?
We want it to be open and free. You can download entire zip file of Futurescape and start playing with Sketch Files directly.
